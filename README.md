# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
This election audit analysis compacted a large amount of data into a few readable lines. By using code to sift through the entire dataset, I was able to practice python while getting a deeper look at the data. Instead of using excel functions to count cells that had sepcific information, I could use a few lines of code to create a text table with very clear answers.
