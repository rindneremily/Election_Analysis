# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit
This election audit analysis compacted a large amount of data into a few readable lines. By using code to sift through the entire dataset, I was able to practice python while getting a deeper look at the data. Instead of using excel functions to count cells that had sepcific information, I could use a few lines of code to create a text table with very clear answers.

## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used and modified to find data on any candidate or county added to the dataset. For future elections, you could add other counties that you want to find data on in order to predict how they would vote. You could save my analysis and use it to determine what percentage of each county likes each candidate and their policies. Using a modified version of the script could also be beneficial for politicians who want to increase voter turnouts in certain counties. The current script is very clear on the winner and where their votes come from. The image below proves that this script can be interpreted by anybody no matter the skill level.
